# Reference Run Report — RUN-20261002-05 (final campaign, C0015)

[Run index](README.md) · [Study reading guide](../docs/README.md) · [Validation scope](../docs/validation/README.md)


Window: 2026-10-02 05:41:00Z – 06:12:00Z. Ledger: [evidence/runs/RUN-20261002-05/](../evidence/runs/RUN-20261002-05/).

## Summary

The lab replayed the C0015 intrusion end to end under one run id: macro self-write
entry (S1) → discovery and credential access from the beachhead (S4–S7b) → SMB handoff
and WMI pivot (S8a/S8b) → second session with server-side receipt (S9) → collection
(S10) → two rclone transfer rounds to the internal sink (S11a/b with RDP between) →
remote-tool deployment (S13) → bounded impact with verified rollback (S14).

## Detection results

At run time the suite had 22 rules (R01–R21, including R14a/R14b). R21 was later retired and R22–R24 added; the current suite has 24 rules. The alerting rules at this run were: R17 (WMI pivot), R18 (proxy-spawned
egress). Raw stored counts for the window (upper bounds; suppression applies at
execution): R16=340 (no suppression configured), R14b=288 (BB), R10=78, R14a=72,
R12=33, R11=9, R18=9, R13=8, R17=3, R15=2, R20=3. R19 produced no alert in this window (rule imported after the run window; the Type-10
logons at 06:00:27Z are noted in the ledger). R21 was retired after this run.

Analyst correlation guidance: R14a/R14b/R16 and earlier discovery provide context for R17; R05/R09/R10/R11/R04 provide context for R18. The rules evaluate raw events and do not consume those building-block alerts. See the [catalogue](../detections/README.md).

## Partial stages and limitations

- **S6 is NOT RUN** in this run. End-to-end wording describes the executed replay and its defined acceptance scope, not PASS for every numbered stage.

- **S12 (RDP) — PARTIAL**: interactive it.admin logons (4624 LogonType 10) were recorded at
  06:00:27Z (logon ids 0x2d1c6d0/0x2d1c733). R19 produced no alert in this window because the rule
  was imported after the run window. The current ledger also records 4634 Type 10 at **06:01:07.328Z**, joined to the first logon by FS01 TargetLogonId **0x2d1c6d0**. This does not establish the lifecycle of the second T10 or separate reconnect/disconnect behavior.
- **S14 impact** is a bounded, allowlist-capped, reversible surrogate; the corpus/backup
  comparison at run time was one-directional (corpus vs backup); the surrogate code has since been hardened to a bidirectional comparison - the running verification for future runs must come from a new run.
- **S11**: no rclone-specific rule was available in this run (current R24 was added later); the transfer is evidenced by the
  rclone E1/E3 and the ART-09-01 receipts (hash equality vs ART-08-01 manifest).
- Alert volumes are raw stored counts; dedup is enforced by the suppression groups at
  rule execution and should be re-measured rather than assumed.

## RDP lifecycle provenance update

The current committed ledger records a same-FS01 **Type-10** logon-to-logoff join:

| Record | UTC event time | Elasticsearch ID |
|---|---|---|
| 4624 logon | 2026-10-02T06:00:27.723Z | `AaD7M6iPmO7CP6NICR_v` |
| 4634 logoff | 2026-10-02T06:01:07.328Z | `AaD7M6iPmO7CP6PqEWBE` |

Join: **4624.TargetLogonId == 4634.TargetLogonId (same host, same boot)**, with the same recorded account/logon type and logoff after logon.
This updates earlier “session lifetime not captured” wording; it does not establish
4778 reconnect or 4779 disconnect. S12 remains PARTIAL in the retained ledger.
The report uses the timestamp precision committed in the ledger.
